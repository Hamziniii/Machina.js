My discord.js wrapper<br>

## Start
To get started, make sure you have typescript.
I would recommend getting the cli tool [Typescript Node Dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev).
This tool is like nodemon, but for ts and it doesnt output js. 
If you want some project examples, go into the example folder. 
I would highly recommend looking at the example folder because it gives a general outline of what you should do. 

## Decorator (class) vs No decorators
There are two methods of using this: decorators or no decorators. 
For decorators you need to use javascript classes with typescript decorators. (Make sure you enable expermental decorators for ts)<br>
There is nothing more you need to do if you don't want to use decorators. 
There also is nothing stoping you from using both.
